					<h3>We're Different</h3>
					<span class="old_way">
						<img src="images/different_img.png"/>
						<h4>The Old Way</h4>
						<p>In the past, one of the biggest challenges in growing a successful online business was choosing the appropriate technology for your business needs. For many, it was a difficult choice because merchants had to do it first, locking them into the way that technology worked, not the way the merchant wanted to. Merchants soon found that the solution they chose was either too limited to allow them to grow, or too complicated to get up and running efficiently.
						</p>
						<p>
						Being locked in to a specific, one-size fits all technology was not very conducive to businesses that needed to set themselves apart and do things differently. They soon found that if they wanted to grow, they would need to spend a lot of time, resources and money to take the next big jump. 
						</p>
					</span>
					<span class="apps">
						<h4>Apps Are Where It's At</h4>
						<p>With anyCommerce's app-based commerce framework, your stores are now custom tailored to your business needs. As your business grows and your needs change, through app updates, your store can change right along with it. And the best part is, you don't have to start over from scratch everytime! Your store is designed to accomodate iterative updates, allowing you more flexibility as your business grows.</p>
					</span>
					<span class="apps_provide">
						<h4>Apps provide:</h4>
						<ul>
						<li>an enhanced user experience for your customers</li>
						<li>lower opperating costs.</li>
						<li>customization and flexibility (websites have severe limitations).</li>
						<li>quicker time to market - apps take weeks, websites take months.</li>
						<li>deployment options and flexibility.</li>
						</ul>
					</span>
					<span class="everything">
						<h4>Everything is Here</h4>
						<p>anyCommerce incorporates all of the technologies and processes needed to grow successfully, and makes them available through one, easy-to-manage account. anyCommerce's long standing partnerships with proven e-commerce industry names ensures the tightest integration and streamlined functionality for your business process. With over 13 years of field-tested input from thousands of successful online merchants, anyCommerce is poised to lead the next e-commerce revolution.</p>

Or, you can have your own team build your apps. We have standards and guides for them to go by. Just know that they will be held to the same standards and will undergo the same vigorous testing as the apps we build do.<br/><br/>
					Your app will start at the DESIGN stage, move to the DEVELOPMENT stage, and then proceed to the TESTING stage. Expect there to be 2-4 rounds of this process until your app is ready for prime time.

					<p>Our network of developers is bigger than yours. But that's a good thing! It means that we have the appropriate resources to develop your app with all of the functionality and efficiency the app framework affords you. We even make sure that the team members working on your apps are all connected and communicate with one another via a dedicated project management system (Podio). This, along with the development platform known in the industry as GITHUB, your app project stays on track and on time with as many or as few team members necessary.

Does it work on the 20 different phones and 10 different tablets indicated? Yeah, we test for that too. We make sure it does everything it is supposed to do so that when you deploy it, it works.
