					<h3>We're Different</h3>
					<span class="old_way">
						<img src="images/different_img.png"/>
						<h4>The Old Way</h4>
						<p>In the past, one of the biggest challenges in growing a successful online business was choosing the appropriate technology for your business needs. For many, it was a difficult choice because merchants had to do it first, locking them into the way that technology worked, not the way the merchant wanted to. Merchants soon found that the solution they chose was either too limited to allow them to grow, or too complicated to get up and running efficiently.
						</p>
						<p>
						Being locked in to a specific, one-size fits all technology was not very conducive to businesses that needed to set themselves apart and do things differently. They soon found that if they wanted to grow, they would need to spend a lot of time, resources and money to take the next big jump. 
						</p>
					</span>
					<span class="apps">
						<h4>Apps Are Where It's At</h4>
						<p>With anyCommerce's app-based commerce framework, your stores are now custom tailored to your business needs. As your business grows and your needs change, through app updates, your store can change right along with it. And the best part is, you don't have to start over from scratch everytime! Your store is designed to accomodate iterative updates, allowing you more flexibility as your business grows.</p>
					</span>
					<span class="apps_provide">
						<h4>Apps provide:</h4>
						<ul>
						<li>an enhanced user experience for your customers</li>
						<li>lower opperating costs.</li>
						<li>customization and flexibility (websites have severe limitations).</li>
						<li>quicker time to market - apps take weeks, websites take months.</li>
						<li>deployment options and flexibility.</li>
						</ul>
					</span>
					<span class="everything">
						<h4>Everything is Here</h4>
						<p>anyCommerce incorporates all of the technologies and processes needed to grow successfully, and makes them available through one, easy-to-manage account. anyCommerce's long standing partnerships with proven e-commerce industry names ensures the tightest integration and streamlined functionality for your business process. With over 13 years of field-tested input from thousands of successful online merchants, anyCommerce is poised to lead the next e-commerce revolution.</p>

						Build It and They Will Buy<br/><span style="font-size:22px;">(... and have a better experience!)</span>
					</h3>
					<p>At the center of your e-commerce universe is your DataFair, consisting of your business information and your custom apps. But you need to get your apps built and your business information installed, right? We have you covered. Say go, and our project manager will build a team of experts who will help you get up and running quickly and efficiently.<br/><br/>
					Our designers, developers and testers are chomping at the bit to work on your apps. Just let us know what you need and we'll get our best and brightest to build it for you. Or, you can have your own team build your apps. We have standards and guides for them to go by. Just know that they will be held to the same standards and will undergo the same vigorous testing as the apps we build do.<br/><br/>
					Your app will start at the DESIGN stage, move to the DEVELOPMENT stage, and then proceed to the TESTING stage. Expect there to be 2-4 rounds of this process until your app is ready for prime time.

						Development: Build that App

					<p>Our network of developers is bigger than yours. But that's a good thing! It means that we have the appropriate resources to develop your app with all of the functionality and efficiency the app framework affords you. We even make sure that the team members working on your apps are all connected and communicate with one another via a dedicated project management system (Podio). This, along with the development platform known in the industry as GITHUB, means your app project stays on track and on time with as many or as few team members necessary.

						Testing: Is it up to snuff?

					<p>After the design and development stage are complete, the app is then subject to our vigorous testing protocol. Does it work on a desktop in a browser? We test for that. Does it work on the 20 different phones and 10 different tablets indicated? Yeah, we test for that too. We make sure it does everything it is supposed to do so that when you deploy it, it works.

								$50 gigabyte. with a minimum of 2 gigabytes of traffic.
							</ul> Zoovy will be the sole arbiter as to what constitutes a violation of this provision.</p>

						<h4>23. SEARCH ENGINE POLICY</h4>
							<p>Zoovy test sites are all hosted under the "ZOOVY.COM" domain name, and using IP addresses assigned to Zoovy by the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN). 
							Some search engines may not distinquish that each site is separate and therefore the actions of one customer, can affect all customers. For this reason Zoovy has developed a 
							strict policy regarding Search Engine "Spamming" techniques. 
							Customers are explicitly prohibited from:<ul>
								 <li>Cloaking - creating deceptive pages which attempt to trick search engines into giving higher ranking.</li>
								 <li>Writing text or creating links that can be seen by search engines but not by visitors.</li>
								 <li>Participating in link exchanges for the sole purpose of increasing your ranking in search engines.</li>
								 <li>Sending automated queries to Google in an attempt to monitor your site's ranking.</li>
								 <li>Use programs that generate lots of generic doorway pages.</li>
							</ul></p>
						<h4>24. COMMERCIAL EMAIL - SPAMMERS BEWARE</h4>
							<p>The Zoovy system routinely sends commercial email on our customers behalf. Email sent by Zoovy is compliant with all Internet mail standards, and clearly designates "ZOOVY.COM" as the MTA (Message Transfer Agent). Zoovy has agreements with several major ISPs to ensure email originating from our mail servers is not treated as UCE (Unsolicited Commercial Email/SPAM).</p>
							<p>While Zoovy does not monitor the actual content of messages, Zoovy does dictate the possible origins, and formatting of messages transmitted - including both the header and body content. This includes (but is not limited to) how opt-out and unsubscribe links are presented to recipients, along with what merchant identifiable information is transmitted to recipients. Zoovy has taken steps to ensure our email formats are compliant with the guidelines set forth by both the Federal CAN-SPAM ACT of 2004 and the postmaster guidelines for the respective ISPs we work with. </p>
							<p>In accordance with our polices Merchants must agree that any written, electronic, or verbal request by a customer to be unsubscribed must be acted upon within 24 hours - across all merchants marketing campaigns - even those not hosted by Zoovy. Merchants agree not to auto re-subscribe customers who have requested to be removed unless they can prove they have received an authentic request to opt-in the customer. </p>
							<p>In addition any attempt to tamper with the email formats developed by Zoovy such as (but not limited to) including concealing information, including deceptive information (such as false addresses / phone numbers), re-opting in customers who have opted-out, or ignoring opt-out requests will be result in immediate, irrevocable termination of the merchants account, along with complete forfeiture of the merchants data, forfeiture of any dues paid to Zoovy, in addition to any fees later assessed by Zoovy for disruption of service. Upon such an event Zoovy may (in it's sole discretion) share the merchants contact information, sales history, and any other information it deems relevant with any requesting ISP, or government agency upon written or electronic request.</p>

							<p>The mediation and arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the applicable United States Arbitration and Mediation Rules of Arbitration. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and legally binding and judgment may be entered thereon.</p>
							<p>Each party shall be responsible for its share of the mediation, and arbitration fees in accordance with the applicable Rules of Arbitration. In the event a party fails to proceed with arbitration, unsuccessfully challenges the arbitrator's award, or fails to comply with the arbitrator's award, the other party is entitled to costs of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee for having to compel arbitration or defend or enforce the award.</p>
